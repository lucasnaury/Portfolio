      <p>
        Recently double-graduated from Cranfield University (<em>MSc Robotics</em>) and IMT Nord-Europe (Engineering degree), I am currently looking for a position as a <em>robotics engineer</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been passionate about computer science. Through online courses, I learned various
        languages (<em>HTML, CSS, JS, VueJS, C#, C++, C, Python, Java</em>...)
        to satisfy my curiosity. I have also created several personal projects during my free time, which you can browse <a href="#portfolio">below</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I now wish to specialize in <em>robotics</em> and <em>embedded electronics</em>,
        which is why I continued my studies in this field. I therefore have knowledge in <em>programming</em> (Python, C++, ROS2), <em>autonomous navigation, robot manipulation, machine vision</em>...

                On the structure, <em>docking points</em> are attached, containing magnetic disks. Thus, by toggling the electromagnet's state, the robot can attach/detach itself from the structure.

                The greater the distance to cover, the longer the execution time, but it remains reasonable since it is executed offline.

        <h1>Project #1 - CONTROL</h1>
        <p>
          A PC game developed during the summer of 2020 using <em>Unity 3D</em>. The concept is simple: you control a character, 
          and you need to reach the portal to move on to the next level. To do so, you can <em>take control of other characters</em> 
          in the level by "shooting" them. Each character has <em>special abilities</em>, so the player must strategize to complete the level.
